## [2025-06-09] - Rethinking My Approach

Over the last few weeks, I dedicated a lot of time to deeply learning Linux, networking and python, way beyond the basics. While it was valuable, I’ve come to a key realization:

> For cybersecurity (especially red teaming), it's not about becoming a network engineer, system admin or programmer. It's about knowing just enough to think like an attacker.

I don’t regret going deep — every bit of knowledge sharpens my edge. But going forward, I'm prioritizing speed and relevance. From now on, I’ll focus on:
- Fundamentals that support offensive security
- Applying knowledge through hacking tools and real-world scenarios
- Learning by doing — through labs, CTFs, and attack simulations

**Goal:** Stay lean, practical, and focused on landing my first cybersecurity role before 2026.

🔁 Back to building. Expect more technical commits, walkthroughs, and progress soon.
